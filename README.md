1. Create a directory and have at least 1 source file (main.cpp - for example).
2. In your project directory create CMakeLists.txt file (the name is very important! make sure you copy it correctly)
3. Copy the content of file CMakeLists.txt in this repository and fill in the missing parts ,marked <> in the file (remove the <> brackets).

4. Now you should create a "build" dir:
5. run:
	> mkdir build
6. cd to build and run:
	> cmake ../
	> make
