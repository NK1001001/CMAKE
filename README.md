### Create a directory and have at least 1 source file (main.cpp - for example).
```
$ mkdir test_cmake
$ cd !$
$ vim main.cpp
```
### In your project directory create CMakeLists.txt file (the name is very important! make sure you copy it correctly)
```
vim CMakeLists.txt
```
### Copy the content of file CMakeLists.txt in this repository and fill in the missing parts ,marked <> in the file (remove the <> brackets).


### Now you should create a "build" dir and run:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build #or cd !$
$ cmake ../
$ make
```
